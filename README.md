Dear User! you can test this code in a simple code editor just by searching an Online Editor in a browser, you don't need an installed editor at all. If these table formats are usefull for you, you can easily change the content and write anything you want. The tags that you can change their content are: <caption>, <th> & <td> tags.
Dear Developer! This code is not anything more than a practice and it's not something you need to learn or use. I just wanted to give it a try!
Most important thing about this code is to figure out, how HTML tables can have cells that span over multiple rows and/or columns.
